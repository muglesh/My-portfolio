                            I'm a Computer Science Engineering graduate with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence
                            from Chandigarh University, passionate about developing smart, user-friendly web
                            applications. I enjoy working with technologies like React, Tailwind CSS,
                            Firebase, and Redux Toolkit to build responsive and dynamic interfaces. My interests span

                            features into everyday tools. Iâ€™m always
                            eager to learn new technologies, take on challenging problems, and collaborate on impactful
